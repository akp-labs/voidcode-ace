# VoidCode Ace – Lightweight Web Code Editor

VoidCode Ace — a high-performance, lightweight code editor designed for speed, precision, and versatility. Built to handle multiple languages with a sleek interface, it empowers developers to write, test(HTML only), and manage code efficiently while keeping the VoidCode ecosystem vibe alive.

VoidCode Ace is a compact, browser-based code editor built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, powered internally by the Ace Editor engine.
It is designed for learners, hobbyists, and developers who want a **fast, portable, low-storage editor** for writing and testing code without installing heavy IDEs.
It runs entirely on the client side, works offline(once cached), and focuses on clarity, control, and direct interaction with code.

⚠️ Note: This project is intentionally minimal and evolving. Features, behaviors, and internal logic may be incomplete or experimental. Bugs and gaps are expected and welcome to be explored.
